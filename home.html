        <h2>Welcome to HBM's Guide to Prince William County Voter Resources</h2>
        <p>Did you know that there are elections EVERY YEAR in Virginia? </p>
        <p>Do you know whether or not you are registered to vote?</p>
        <p>Do you know who currently represents you at the state and local levels?</p>
        <p>Do you know who is running this year?</p>
		<p>This site aims to educate all voters within Prince William County, Virginia, about which elections are held each year and the candidates running in each race.</p>
		<p>This site is non-partisan and non-political. All content shown on candidate pages this website links to is their own intellectual property and opinion. This site is for education, so that you can be an informed voter.</p>
        <h2>What can we help you with?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click on 2019 Elections to learn which offices are up for election this year.</li>
          <li>Click on 2019 Candidates to see who is running for each office, and access links to their official campaign websites.</li>
          <li>Click on Helpful Links to access official websites of Virginia and Prince William County government and other valuable voter information.</li>
        </ul>
		  <p>Who is Hotel Bravo Mike, anyway? Well, I'm just a regular person who is concerned about the apparent low-level of knowledge around the county about how Virginia elections work. I simply want everyone to know how to make their voices heard at the polls.
